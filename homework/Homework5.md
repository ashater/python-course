# Class 5 Review and Homework 5

Class 5 was a review session of Homework 4 and introduction of ```functions```

The key review item was use of ```if`` statements and also dictionaries:

```python
user_pass = {'leo': 'bestcod_12', 'phil':'codwarrior32'}
user_shape = {'leo' : 'triangle', 'phil': 'square'}
```

Assume our username is 'leo', kne can ask for a password like below:

```python
input_user = 'leo'
input_password = turtle.textinput('Enter Your Password','Input Password')

# check for password
if input_password == user_pass[input_user]:
    turtle.shape(user_shape[input_user])
else: # if we didn't match
    turtle.write("Access denied")
```
Above concise piece of code will use an associative property of a dictionary to use ```user_pass[input_user]``` to lookup Leo's password. Once it looks it up, it will compare to the password inputted in our text input box. 

Alternative way to do this check is the following:

```python
input_user = 'leo'
input_password = turtle.textinput('Enter Your Password','Input Password')

if input_user == 'leo':
    if input_password == 'bestcod_12':
        turtle.shape('triangle')
elif input_user == 'phil':
    if input_password == 'codwarrior32':
        turtle.shape('square')
else: # if we didn't match
    turtle.write("Access denied")
```

# Functions 

Functions are chunks of code that tell Python to do something. They are one way to reuse codeâ€”you can use functions in your programs again and again. We also can use modules full functions. 

## Remember: ```turtle``` is a module full of functions

 Examples of functions used in class:
 ```python
 def our_shapes(name):

    user_shape = {'leo': 'triangle', 'phil': 'square'}
    turtle.shape(user_shape[name])

```

# Homework 5

1. Create 3 separate functions to draw triangle, square and hexagon. You **CANNOT** use ```turtle.shape``` function, please draw using ```turtle.forward``` per our earlier homeworks. 

2. Create code to ask for user input and draw shapes using functions from #1. 

Extra credit:

Using template below, start moving the shape around but replace ```turtle.shape``` with your code for shape:

```python
import turtle
screen = turtle.Screen()
turtle.shape('square') #### REPLACE ME
def left():
    turtle.penup()
    turtle.backward(100)
    turtle.pendown()
    
screen.onkey(left, "Left")
screen.listen()
screen.mainloop()

```
