### Class 8 continuation of building a video game


We mostly went over building blocks for BrickBreaker and tried to move the player paddle. 
We also learned how to detect Y axis collision of the ball with the paddle. 
We also went over how to create a list of bricks.

Your homework is to make changes in the ```move``` function:


- Please try to identify the ball hitting a paddle across X direction (using ```pad_x``` and ```x``` variables and ```if``` statement)
- Please reverse direction when your ball strikes the paddle, note reversing ball is just changing addition vs. subtraction. Try to change the angle of the balls. 
- Add a loop to detect collision on all of the blocks in the our ```all_bricks``` list
